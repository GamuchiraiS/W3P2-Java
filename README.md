# W3P2-Java

Write a Java class which has the following methods:
 get_String - accept a string from the user
 print_Upper to print the string in upper case
 print_Lower to print the string in lower case
To test your class, create an instance of the class, and use the get_String method to ask the user for a string. Then print the string in upper case and in lower case using the methods from your class.
